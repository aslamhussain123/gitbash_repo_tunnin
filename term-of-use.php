                        <p> Welcome to ClassPass! These Terms of Use (“Terms”) are a contract between you and ClassPass Inc. (“ClassPass” or
                            “we”) and govern your access to and use of any ClassPass website, mobile application (such as for iPhone or Android) or
                            content (the “Site”) or any fitness, recreational, wellness, or other classes, experiences, activities, events, services,
                            recordings, and/or products made available through ClassPass (collectively, “Classes”). Please read these Terms
                            carefully before accessing and/or using the Site and/or Classes.</p>

                        <p>THESE TERMS CONTAIN A BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER THAT REQUIRE YOU
                            TO ARBITRATE ALL DISPUTES YOU HAVE WITH CLASS PASS ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. PLEASE SEE SECTION 18
                            FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER. YOU EXPRESSLY
                            AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND CLASSPASS WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL
                            ARBITRATION, AND YOU HEREBY WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS
                            WIDE ARBITRATION.</p>

                        <p class="no-margin">1. Terms of Use.</p>
                        <p> a) Acceptance of Terms. By accessing and/or using the Site and/or Classes, or clicking any button to indicate your
                            consent, you accept and agree to be bound by these Terms, just as if you had agreed to these Terms in writing. If you do
                            not agree to these Terms, do not use the Site or any Classes.</p>

                        <p>b) Amendment of Terms. ClassPass may amend the Terms from time to time. Unless we provide a delayed effective date,
                            all amendments will be effective upon posting of such updated Terms. Your continued access to or use of the Site or
                            Classes after such posting constitutes your consent to be bound by the Terms, as amended.</p>

                        <p>c) Additional Terms. In addition to these Terms, certain plans, offers, products, services, elements or features may also
                            be subject to additional terms, conditions guidelines or rules which may be posted, communicated or modified by us or
                            applicable third parties at any time. Your use of any such plan, offer, product, service, element or feature is subject to
                            those additional terms and conditions, which are hereby incorporated by reference into the Terms, provided that in the
                            event of any conflict between such additional terms and the Terms, the Terms shall control. The ClassPass Privacy Policy
                            is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>

                        <p  class="no-margin">2. ClassPass Platform</p>

                        <p>a) ClassPass Platform. The ClassPass platform enables consumers to reserve, schedule, purchase, access and attend a
                            wide range of fitness, recreational and wellness Classes offered and operated by fitness studios, gyms, trainers, venues
                            or other third parties (collectively, “Venues”). ClassPass itself is not a gymnasium, place of amusement or recreation,
                            health club, facility, fitness studio or similar establishment and does not own, operate or control any of the Classes that
                            are offered at or through such facilities.</p>

                        <p>b) Membership Options. There are a number of ways to participate in Classes through ClassPass, such as various
                            subscription plans, promotional plans, digital Classes, and non-subscription purchases. These options consist of
                            different classes, services and features and may be subject to additional and differing conditions, prices, policies and
                            limitations. We reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered options and plans at any time in our
                            discretion. From time to time we may permit non-subscribers to access certain Classes, content or features for a cost or
                            at no cost. ClassPass makes no commitment on the quantity, availability, type or frequency at which such Classes,
                            content and features will be available to non-subscribers and may modify, discontinue, remove or suspend access at any
                            time and for any reason in our sole discretion.</p>

                        <p>c) Subscription Plans. To enjoy full access to the Site and Classes, you need to sign up for a subscription. A subscription
                            starts on the date that you sign up for a subscription and submit payment via a valid Payment Method (defined below) or
                            reactivate a pre-existing subscription. Unless we otherwise communicate a different time period to you at the time of sign
                            up or otherwise (such as a multi-month commitment plan), each billing cycle is one month in length (a “Subscription
                            Cycle”). Your ClassPass subscription automatically renews each month, and we will automatically bill the monthly
                            subscription fee to your Payment Method each month, until your subscription is cancelled or terminated. For example, if
                            you purchase your ClassPass subscription on April 5, your subscription will automatically renew on May 5 (as further
                            explained in “Subscription Cycles,” below). You must provide us with a current, valid, accepted method of payment
                            (“Payment Method”). We may update the accepted methods from time to times. If you add a subscription to your base
                            subscription or if you upgrade or downgrade to a different subscription, all such subscriptions will be governed by these
                            Terms and will continue indefinitely until canceled or terminated.</p>

                        <p>d) Use of Credits. Depending on the subscription plan you choose and purchase, you will be allotted credits to be used
                            solely to book Classes each Subscription Cycle. You can choose how you use your credits across the various Classes
                            available to you.</p>

                        <p>Credits expire at the end of each Subscription Cycle, meaning that any credits you don’t use during the applicable</p>
