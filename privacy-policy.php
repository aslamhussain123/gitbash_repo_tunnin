                            information we collect automatically may include information like internet protocol (“IP”) address, device type, unique
                            device identification numbers, browser-type, broad geographic location (e.g. country or city-level location) and other

                            pages accessed and links clicked</p>

                        <p>We may also collect precise geolocation data pertaining to your mobile device, if you have consented to providing this to
                            us through your device settings. We may use this information to provide, promote, and improve our services (for

                            security purposes. Please note that if you do not consent to providing your geolocation data, certain features of the
                            mobile application may not work.</p>

                        <p>The information we collect automatically enables us to better understand the visitors who come to our Site, where they

                            consent or are otherwise legally permitted or required to disclose your personal information to us. For example, studio
